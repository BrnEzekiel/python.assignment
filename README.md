Simple Calculator
This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python that performs the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple program that takes user input, performs a series of calculations, and displays the results. It's a great example of a beginner-friendly program that covers basic concepts like variable assignment, user input, and simple arithmetic.

Features
Addition: Calculates the sum of two numbers.

Subtraction: Calculates the difference between two numbers.

Multiplication: Calculates the product of two numbers.

Division: Calculates the quotient of two numbers.

How to Run
To run this calculator, you will need to have Python installed on your machine.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository-name

Run the Python script:

python calculator.py

Follow the prompts: The program will ask you to enter two numbers. After you enter them, it will display the results of the calculations.

Code Overview
The calculator.py file is a straightforward script that:

Prompts the user to enter a first and second number.

Stores these numbers as floating-point variables (num1 and num2) to allow for decimal values.

Performs the four arithmetic operations.

Prints the results to the console in a clear and readable format.

Future Improvements
Add error handling for division by zero.

Include an option for the user to choose which operation to perform.

Implement a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
